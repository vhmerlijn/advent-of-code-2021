    "## Day 19: Beacon Scanner\n",
    "\n",
    "https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/19\n",
    "\n",
    "For a moment, consider only two dimensions. Suppose you have the following scanner reports: `day19-1.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here is an arrangement of beacons as seen from a scanner in the same position but in different orientations: `day19-2.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "By finding pairs of scanners that both see at least 12 of the same beacons, you can assemble the entire map. For example, consider the following report: `day19-3.txt` - In total, there are 79 beacons.\n",
    "\n",
